SOLUTION:

Technical Solution to Identify Accused Individuals Using VPN & TOR for Hoax Bomb Threats:
Cybercriminals use VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) and TOR (The Onion Router) to mask their identities while sending hoax bomb threats to airlines and agencies. However, investigators can use a combination of cybersecurity tools, network forensics, AI-driven analysis, and OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) techniques to track down the accused.

1. Identifying VPN & TOR Users
Step 1: Detect VPN & TOR through Traffic Analysis
???? Determine if the user is connected via a VPN or TOR.
✅ Technical Implementation:

Use VPN & TOR Exit Node Databases (like MaxMind, IPQualityScore, IP2Location).
Look for a match from the sender's IP to the known VPN or TOR exit nodes.
Apply DPI techniques on network traffic patterns.
???? Flag the traffic when an IP is identified from a VPN/TOR exit node.

Step 2: Traffic Correlation Analysis (Timing Attacks)
???? Correlate the timestamps of message sending and network traffic.
✅ Technical Implementation:

Capture traffic logs using SIEM tools such as Splunk, Graylog, or ELK Stack.
Compare when the hoax message was sent with when a new VPN/TOR session started.
If the suspect uses a public Wi-Fi + VPN, collect the MAC address from Wi-Fi logs.
???? If a particular user connects to VPN and immediately sends a threat, flag them for investigation.

2. De-Anonymizing the VPN/TOR User
Step 3: DNS Leaks & WebRTC IP Leak Exploitation
???? Extract real IP even if the user is using a VPN.
✅ Technical Implementation:

Use WebRTC Leak Tests (STUN Requests) to force the browser to reveal the real IP address.
If the suspect uses a misconfigured VPN, it may leak its original DNS requests.
Monitor VPN misconfiguration issues via tools like Wireshark, TCPDump.
???? If a real IP is exposed, immediately track it back to the ISP.

Step 4: Analyzing Bitcoin Transactions for Paid VPN Users
???? Many criminals pay for VPNs using cryptocurrency.
✅ Technical Implementation:

Use blockchain forensics tools (Chainalysis, CipherTrace, Elliptic) to trace cryptocurrency transactions.
If the suspect paid for a VPN using Bitcoin, track the wallet address.
Cross-check Bitcoin wallets with known darknet markets and exchanges to find real identities.
???? If the Bitcoin wallet is linked to an exchange (like Binance, Coinbase), subpoena the exchange for KYC details.

Step 5: OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) & Social Engineering
Gather real-world clues about the suspect.
Technical Implementation:

OSINT tools- Maltego, SpiderFoot, Shodan, FOCA track usernames and emails on social media.
Abusers have a common alias that they may use on more than one service.
Check breached databases - DeHashed, Have I Been Pwned, for leaked private information.
???? If a username or email corresponds to a real-world identity, investigators can find the accused.

3. Legal & Cybersecurity Measures for Investigators
Step 6: Subpoena VPN & Hosting Providers
???? Most VPN providers claim they don't log data, but some do.
✅ Technical Implementation:

Identify the VPN provider and check if they store connection logs.
Use legal channels to request metadata logs from VPN companies (some providers like ExpressVPN, NordVPN, and ProtonVPN don't keep logs, but others do).
Investigate email addresses or payment details used for VPN registration.
???? If logs are available, they can reveal the suspect's real IP address.

Step 7: Examining Dark Web & TOR Markets
 ???? If the defendant utilized TOR, then it must be determined whether dark web activity was used
✅ Technical Implementation:
Apply Dark Web Monitoring Tools: DarkOwl, Memex, Flashpoint.
Scan for leaked threat messages, aliases, or hacker forum discussion.
If the defendant communicated regarding the bomb threat on the dark web, engage in honey trap operations and pull personal details.
If an association between the TOR activity and the suspect exists, track aliases and identify.

4. Investigators' Final Action Plan
 Multi-Step Tracking of the Accused
????
1. Analyze IP & Traffic Data → Detect VPN/TOR users & check for leaks.
2. Use Traffic Correlation & Timing Attacks → Find when VPN is used.
3. Check WebRTC & DNS Leaks → Extract real IP if misconfigured.
4️⃣ Trace Cryptocurrency Payments → Uncover real identities.
5️⃣ Use OSINT & Social Engineering → Match usernames with real-world data.
6️⃣ Subpoena VPN Providers & Hosting Services → Retrieve account details.
7️⃣ Monitor the Dark Web → Identify discussions about hoax threats.
