Technical Solution to Identify & Delete Impersonation Accounts of Influential People through Social Media
Problem Statement:
Criminals open impersonation profiles of celebrities, public figures, or influencers on social media and fool their friends/ followers to wire money. The task is to identify, mark, and auto-delete such fake accounts with a technical solution.

1. Multi-Layered Method to Identify Fake Profiles
Components of the Solution:
AI-based Profile Authentication
Face Recognition and Image Analysis
Text-Based Anomaly Detection
✅ Behavioral Analysis & Activity Monitoring
✅ Crowd-Sourced Reporting & Machine Learning Based Validation

2. Algorithmic Solution to Detecting Fake Accounts
Step 1: Profile Image Verification through Face Recognition
???? Catch duplication of the profile image as already existing in the verified account, the same image has been uploaded.
✅ Technical Solution:
Extract face embeddings through FaceNet or DeepFace.
Compare against an in-house database of profiles officially verified.
Use reverse image search (Google Vision API, TinEye) to see if the image is stolen.
???? If matches are found, flag the account as a fake.

Step 2: Account Name & Username Similarity Detection
???? Account Names with minor modifications impersonate famous personalities.
✅ Technical Implementation:
Use Levenshtein Distance Algorithm or Fuzzy Matching to identify similar names in accounts.
Example:
Authentic Account: "ElonMusk"
Fake Account: "EIonMusk" capital "I" instead of "L".
Fake Account: "Elon_Musk_Official"
???? If the similarity score exceeds a threshold (e.g., 90%), flag for review.

Step 3: Text & Chat-Based Fraud Detection
???? Analyze DMs (Direct Messages) and posts for scam-related text.
✅ Technical Implementation:

Use NLP (Natural Language Processing) models like BERT or GPT-based classifiers to detect suspicious phrases:
"Urgent help needed, please transfer money."
"I lost my wallet, can you send $500?"
"I'm investing in crypto, send me BTC."
Detect abusing of urgency, emotional blackmail and monetary demands.
-Flag accounts re-sending spammy messages.

Step 4: Behavioural & Activity Analysis
-Identify abnormal patterns of activities
Technical Implementation
-New account with sudden changes as:
receiving thousands of followers within hours. Use bot detection.
Sending hundreds of friend requests/messages in a single day.
Their previous activities are zero since they have a low activity score
-In such cases, suspend the account or get it reviewed automatically.

Step 5: Crowdsourced Reporting + AI-Based Validation
???? Enable user reporting but reduce false positives.
✅ Technical Implementation:
Users can report suspicious accounts.
AI verifies whether reports are legit (example: by voting system + historical data).
Accounts with repeated infringements are automatically deleted.
3. Technologies Needed
????️ Implementation Stack
Feature\tTechnology Used
Face Recognition\tDeepFace, OpenCV, FaceNet
Image Similarity Check\tGoogle Vision API, TinEye API
NLP Fraud Detection\tTransformers (BERT, GPT), spaCy, NLTK
Behavior Analysis\tScikit-learn, XGBoost, Anomaly Detection Models
Bot Detection\tCAPTCHA, Recurrent Behavior Analysis
4. Automated Fake Account Delete System
✅ Social media firms can introduce Fake Account Ranking System:

Score between 0 and 100 based on face recognition, name similarity, chat analysis, behavior, and reports.
If score > 85, the account gets auto-deleted.
If score is between 70 and 85, the account will be given for human review.
Final Action Workflow:
Fake Account Identified → Suspended for Temporary Period
Revalidation Step (AI + Human Review)
Confirmed Fake? → Auto-deletion + Ban IP/MAC Address
