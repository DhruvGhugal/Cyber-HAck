SOLUTION:

Technical Solution for Rented Bank Accounts to Thwart Cybercrime Gangs:
Cyber fraudsters rent savings and current accounts to carry out money laundering, phishing scams, and financial fraud. A multi-layered AI-based fraud detection system can prevent such activities of rented accounts being carried out by cyber fraudsters in real time.

1. Key Challenges with Detecting Rented Accounts
Account Holder vs. Actual User Mismatch- The person who opens the account is different from the one who uses it.
✔️ Many Transactions Over Wide Geographical Distribution – Money laundering patterns.
✔️ Large Quantity of Cash in Frequent Deposit & Withdrawals – Thieves use accounts for money muling.
✔️ New Accounts Opened with Increased Transaction Volumes – Suddenly moving funds around

2. Two-Tier Fraud Detection Solution
Step 1: AI Behavioral Analysis
???? Detect transaction behavior that falls outside of patterns using Machine Learning (ML)
✅ Tech Implementation:

 Train anomaly detection models (Isolation Forest, LSTM, or Autoencoders) on the trends of transactions
Mark accounts who have:
Atypical cash inflows/outflows
Frequent international transactions
Number of large deposits with instant transfer
No spending activity but frequent high-value fund transfers
Assign a Fraud Risk Score (0-100).
If Risk Score > 80: Auto-freeze account for review.
If Risk Score 60-80: Send alerts to compliance teams.
Step 2: Device & Location-Based Anomaly Detection
???? Detect login patterns from different locations or devices.
✅ Technical Implementation:
 
Use Geolocation tracking to detect logins from multiple cities/countries in a short time.
Monitor Device Fingerprinting (IP, browser, OS, device ID).
Example:
Account opened in New Delhi
First transaction from Mumbai
Second transaction from Dubai in 5 mins ✅ ???? (Suspicious)
Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for high-risk transactions.
???? If an account shows rapid location/device changes, flag it for investigation.

Step 3: AI-Based Identity Verification & Liveness Detection
???? Ensure the account owner is the real user.
✅ Technical Implementation:

Implement AI-based liveness detection using Face Recognition during high-value transactions.
Compare live selfies with original KYC documents
Face mismatch occurs → Suspend the transaction, and alert the legitimate account holder.
Step 4: Transaction Network Analysis & Money Flow Tracking
???? Identify Linked Fraud Accounts.
✅ Technical Implementation:
Neo4j or NetworkX uses graph-based fraud detection to establish transaction patterns
Money mule networks can be identified by analysing the following patterns:
Suspect clusters of accounts are exchanging frequent transactions with each other
Several accounts sending money to one single recipient.
Accounts conducting serial cash withdrawals shortly after receipt.
If multiple rented accounts are associated → Suspend all concerned accounts.
???? If an account is associated with several flagged accounts, auto-forward for review.

Step 5: Biometric-Based ATM & Online Transaction Security
???? Use biometric authentication for high-risk transactions
✅ Technical Deployment:
Fingerprint or facial recognition at ATMs for withdrawals above a certain limit
Behavioral biometrics, keystroke dynamics, typing pattern recognition to authenticate online banking users.
Step 6: AI Chatbot for Customer Education
✅ Educate the customers through AI-driven fraud detection chatbots that raise alerts when:

High-risk transaction is attempted
Suspicious activity in an account
Fraudulent messages regarding rented accounts are received.

4. Final Action Plan for Banks
???? AI-Based Fraud Scoring System
1️⃣ Analyze transactions in real-time using AI models.
2️⃣ Flag high-risk accounts based on fraud risk scores.
3️⃣ Freeze accounts with repeated suspicious behavior.
4️⃣ Verify suspicious accounts using biometric and liveness detection.
5️⃣ Alert law enforcement if a large fraud network is detected.

Conclusion
Using AI-based fraud detection, biometric verification, transaction pattern analysis, and network graph analytics, banks will be able to identify and flag rented accounts for financial fraud in time before serious damage is caused.
